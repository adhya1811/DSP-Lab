## Sine Wave Generation Using TMS320C6748 DSP Development Kit
## Introduction
The TMS320C6748 DSP Development Kit is a high-performance platform for real-time digital signal processing (DSP) tasks. One of the basic tasks in signal processing is the generation of sine waves, which are widely used in audio, communication systems, testing, and control applications.

This README provides an overview of how to generate sine waves using the TMS320C6748 DSP.

## Theory
A sine wave is a periodic waveform with a smooth, continuous oscillation. In a digital system, sine waves are represented by discrete samples calculated at a regular interval, typically at a rate higher than twice the frequency of the wave (the sampling rate), in accordance with the Nyquist theorem.

To generate a sine wave on the TMS320C6748 DSP, the key parameters are:

Frequency (f): The frequency of the sine wave in Hertz (Hz).
Sampling Rate (Fs): The number of samples per second (samples/second). It must be at least twice the frequency of the sine wave to avoid aliasing.
Amplitude (A): The peak value of the sine wave.
Phase (Ï†): The initial phase of the wave (often set to 0 for simplicity).
The DSP computes the samples of the sine wave by evaluating the sine function at discrete time intervals.

## Sine Wave Generation on TMS320C6748
The TMS320C6748 DSP Development Kit is equipped with a high-speed processor capable of generating real-time sine wave signals by calculating and outputting discrete samples at a specified frequency and sampling rate. This makes it ideal for applications such as:

Audio signal generation and synthesis.
Modulation in communication systems.
Signal testing in laboratory environments.
Control systems where periodic signals are required.
The DSP's processing power ensures that sine waves can be generated accurately and efficiently, even for high-frequency or complex waveforms.
